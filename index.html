                    Four years ago I began to notice the amazing things Ai was capable of, and immediately I felt like the world was leaving me behind. In order to resolve some of my intense anxiety I decided it was time to learn just how this “Ai” stuff worked. However, first I had to learn to program!

                    After I felt like I had a firm footing in programming, (which I didn’t) I was ready to tackle Ai. I took some an Udemy course, and I was struggling with basic setup of a programming project. I really just wasn’t proficient with computers at the time, and ultimately ended up quitting. While I didn’t do any of the projects, I did watch all of the videos and gained a very intuitive sense of the field.
